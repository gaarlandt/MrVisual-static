# Gemini Code Report: MrVisual Static Website

## Overview

This report provides an analysis of the MrVisual static website codebase. The website is a well-structured, simple, and effective static site, showcasing visual content like AI photos and renders.

## Technology Stack

The website is built using a classic and robust combination of web technologies:

*   **HTML:** The core structure of the website is built with HTML. There are multiple pages (`index.html`, `ai-fotos.html`, `renders.html`), indicating a multi-page architecture.
*   **CSS:** The styling is handled by a single stylesheet (`style.css`), which provides a consistent look and feel across the different pages.
*   **JavaScript:** The website uses a single JavaScript file (`script.js`) for interactive elements and dynamic functionality.

## File Structure

The project has a clear and organized file structure:

```
